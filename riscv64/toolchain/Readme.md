# RISCV toolchains

All of the imported Fedora RISC binaries share a common gcc toolchain and generic compiler options.
These Fedora binaries were likely generated by crosscompiler toolchains like `gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu` and `binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu`.
Toolchains can include system header files amd detailed scripts needed to create an executable the kernel can load and run.

An alternate Linux toolchain is provided by https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, which bundles gcc-12, binutils-2_40, at least two `libc`
system libraries, and a Linux 5.X-like sysroot.  C, C++, and fortran are all supported by this toolchain, plus many RISCV processor-specific
instruction set variants.

A sample C++ main routine compiles with this toolchain and `-fpic` to an object file including these RISCV relocation types:

  R_RISCV_RVC_BRANCH, R_RISCV_CALL_PLT, R_RISCV_RVC_JUMP, R_RISCV_RELAX, R_RISCV_RVC_JUMP, R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20, R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I,
  R_RISCV_BRANCH, R_RISCV_GOT_HI20, R_RISCV_64, R_RISCV_ADD32, R_RISCV_SUB32, R_RISCV_32_PCREL, R_RISCV_SET6, R_RISCV_SUB6, R_RISCV_SET8,
  R_RISCV_SUB8, R_RISCV_SET16, R_RISCV_SUB16, R_RISCV_SET8, and R_RISCV_SUB8

The fully linked unstripped C++ executable shows far fewer relocation types:

  R_RISCV_64, R_RISCV_JUMP_SLOT
